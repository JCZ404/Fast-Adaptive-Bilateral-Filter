# Fast-Adaptive-Bilateral-Filter
This is an unofficial implement of the "Fast Adaptive Bilateral Filter" with Python, the original official implement is here:https://github.com/rgavaska/Fast-Adaptive-Bilateral-Filtering, and the original repo implement the algorithm with Matlab and C++, which need to compile with Mex, so I change the author's Matlab code into the Python code.
